        "definition": "The relationship between a landmark that helps determine a body location and the body location itself. The location relative to a landmark is specified by:\n* Specifying the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation,\n* Specifying the direction from the landmark to the body location, and\n* Specifying the distance from the landmark to the body location.\n\nThe RelationToLandmark element is part of BodyLocation, a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.\n\n+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.\n+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.\n+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:\n- Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and\n- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.\n\nNote that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).",
