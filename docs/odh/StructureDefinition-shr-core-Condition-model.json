        "definition": "A location or structure in the body, including tissues, regions, cavities, and spaces; for example, right elbow, or left ventricle of the heart.\nThe BodyLocation includes code and optional qualifiers of anatomical side or direction. The body location can also be determined from one or more body landmarks.\nIf the code for the body location includes laterality and/or anatomical direction, the corresponding attributes might be unnecessary.\nNote that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how an address structure can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).",
