FHIM: Identifies the computer system that created the medical record. This optional field may also be used to indicate that the medical record was originally created by a different organization from the one that is currently storing or utilizing the record in that the assigning authority of the Id could be set to that originating organization. This property is optional, as some systems will assume that all records that it contains originated in that system, however it is anticipated that it will become increasingly commonplace for records from multiple systems and organizations will be comingled in order to provide a complete picture of the patient's health record.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,1,"ele-1
