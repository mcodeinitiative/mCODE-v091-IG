SHR follows Argonaut and makes the value set binding on marital status required. MaritalStatus has a required binding in Argonaut, but an extensible binding in US-Core. To be feasible under both DSTU2 Argonaut and STU3 US-Core, the required binding strength is adopted.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"http://ncimeta.nci.nih.gov#C1299487
