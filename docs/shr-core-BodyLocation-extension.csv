"Extension","","","",0,*,"","","","","BodyLocation","A location or structure in the body, including tissues, regions, cavities, and spaces; for example, right elbow, or left ventricle of the heart.
The BodyLocation includes code and optional qualifiers of anatomical side or direction. The body location can also be determined from one or more body landmarks.
If the code for the body location includes laterality and/or direction, the LocationQualifier might be unnecessary.
Note that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how the same address structure can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodyLocation (BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,1,"",""
