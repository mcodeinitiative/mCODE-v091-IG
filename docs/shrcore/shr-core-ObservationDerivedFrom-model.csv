Observation has a value representing the result (answer), or an DataAbsentReason indicating why the value is not present. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.
For an Observation, the Code describes the aspect or property of the subject being observed or measured. The Code is the 'question code' that pairs to the 'answer' contained in the Value.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-ObservationDerivedFrom-model.value[x]",1,1,"",""
