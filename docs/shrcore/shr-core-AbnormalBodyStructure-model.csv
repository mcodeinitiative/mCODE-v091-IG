The body structure is a condition that persists over time. The Code represents the body structure itself (the morphology), while the BodyLocation is the location of that structure. This corresponds to FHIR R4, where the BodyStructure resource has morphology (corresponding to Code) and a location. For example, the Code could be blunt force injury (SCT 3821009) and location left knee.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-AbnormalBodyStructure-model",0,*,"",""

Body location is a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.
+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
- Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and
- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.
Note that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-AbnormalBodyStructure-model.bodyLocation",0,*,"",""
