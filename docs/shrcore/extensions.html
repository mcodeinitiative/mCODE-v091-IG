Body location is a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.</li>
  <li>Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.</li>
  <li>Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:</li>
  <li>Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and</li>
  <li>Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.
Note that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR’s stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which ‘is not … intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient’ (FHIR 3.5).</li>
