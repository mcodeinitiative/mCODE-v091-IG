<p>FHIR Notes:</p>

<p>Although FHIR supports the asserter (information source) and date asserted, it does not have a place for the author (who created and is responsible for the statement) and recorder (who entered the statement). Extensions are provided.</p>

<p>The treatment of ‘not taken’ has changed from DSTU2 and STU3 to R4. In R4, status and statusReason are used to indicate medications not taken. For upward compatibility, the ‘not taken’ attributes are profiled out.
ReasonCode is a choice of CodeableConcept or ref(Condition) in DSTU2, and limited to one reason (pick a type). In STU3 and R4, there can be multiple reason codes, and multiple reason references, simultaneously.</p>

<p>Preference is given to using the National Library of Medicine (NLM) RxNorm terminology for medications. RxNorm is a coding standard established by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC). However, RxNorm is restricted to FDA-approved drugs and does not include clinical trial drugs. MedicationStatement allows for the inclusion of other coding systems like the NCI Thesaurus (NCIT) to represent clinical trial oncology drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.</li>
  <li>Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.</li>
  <li>Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:</li>
  <li>Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and</li>
  <li>Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.
Note that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR’s stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which ‘is not … intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient’ (FHIR 3.5).</li>

<p>Note to FHIR implementers: SHR includes Status and Identifier fields on DomainResource because these two attributes occur in almost every FHIR resource. The most significant exception are 3 or 4 resources that use an ‘active’ flag instead of coded status value. There is no apparent pattern to this inconsistency. FHIR resources that use a coded status have active and inactive as status values. In the spirit of providing a consistent object-oriented logical model for FHIR, SHR uses status across all domain resources.</p>

<p>The laterality element is part of BodyLocation, a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.</li>
  <li>Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.</li>
  <li>Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:</li>
  <li>Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and</li>
  <li>Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR’s stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which ‘is not … intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient’ (FHIR 3.5).</p>

The orientation element is part of BodyLocation, a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.</li>
  <li>Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.</li>
  <li>Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:</li>
  <li>Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and</li>
  <li>Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR’s stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which ‘is not … intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient’ (FHIR 3.5).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Specifying the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation,</li>
  <li>Specifying the direction from the landmark to the body location, and</li>
  <li>Specifying the distance from the landmark to the body location.</li>
</ul>

<p>The RelationToLandmark element is part of BodyLocation, a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.</li>
  <li>Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.</li>
  <li>Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:</li>
  <li>Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and</li>
  <li>Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR’s stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which ‘is not … intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient’ (FHIR 3.5).</p>
