Body location is a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.\n+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.\n+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.\n+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:\n- Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and\n- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.\nNote that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).",

A person can have more than one job at the same time and multiple jobs over time, so the data related to each job must remain in the record in perpetuity. Each job should be recorded in a separate instance of PastOrPresentJob. A person’s job can be a social determinant of their health and information about a person’s job can support patient care, population health, and public health. In patient care, knowledge of a person’s past or present job(s) can impact recognition, diagnosis, management, and treatment of injuries and illnesses. These data also can be used for clinical decision support and to prompt discussion of preventive care measures. For example, a record of jobs that require prolonged time in the sun might prompt a health care provider to inquire if the person wears protective clothing or sunscreen while working. At a minimum, it is important to have a record of a person’s current job(s); i.e., the job(s) in which a person is engaged at the time that he or she presents to a health care provider, regardless of duration, and to retain that information over time. In the event a person recently stopped working (e.g. retired without another job, became unemployed or disabled and unable to work), the most recent job(s) is used instead of the current job(s).",

The use may be reported by the patient or clinician and adminstration does not have to be directly observed.\n\nFHIR Notes:\n\nAlthough FHIR supports the asserter (information source) and date asserted, it does not have a place for the author (who created and is responsible for the statement) and recorder (who entered the statement). Extensions are provided.\n\nThe treatment of 'not taken' has changed from DSTU2 and STU3 to R4. In R4, status and statusReason are used to indicate medications not taken. For upward compatibility, the 'not taken' attributes are profiled out.\nReasonCode is a choice of CodeableConcept or ref(Condition) in DSTU2, and limited to one reason (pick a type). In STU3 and R4, there can be multiple reason codes, and multiple reason references, simultaneously.\n\nPreference is given to using the National Library of Medicine (NLM) RxNorm terminology for medications. RxNorm is a coding standard established by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC). However, RxNorm is restricted to FDA-approved drugs and does not include clinical trial drugs. MedicationStatement allows for the inclusion of other coding systems like the NCI Thesaurus (NCIT) to represent clinical trial oncology drugs.",
