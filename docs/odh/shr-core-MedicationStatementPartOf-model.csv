Observation has a value representing the result (answer), or an DataAbsentReason indicating why the value is not present. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.
For an Observation, the Code describes the aspect or property of the subject being observed or measured. The Code is the 'question code' that pairs to the 'answer' contained in the Value.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-MedicationStatementPartOf-model.value[x]",1,1,"",""

FHIR Notes:

Although FHIR supports the asserter (information source) and date asserted, it does not have a place for the author (who created and is responsible for the statement) and recorder (who entered the statement). Extensions are provided.

The treatment of 'not taken' has changed from DSTU2 and STU3 to R4. In R4, status and statusReason are used to indicate medications not taken. For upward compatibility, the 'not taken' attributes are profiled out.
ReasonCode is a choice of CodeableConcept or ref(Condition) in DSTU2, and limited to one reason (pick a type). In STU3 and R4, there can be multiple reason codes, and multiple reason references, simultaneously.

Preference is given to using the National Library of Medicine (NLM) RxNorm terminology for medications. RxNorm is a coding standard established by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC). However, RxNorm is restricted to FDA-approved drugs and does not include clinical trial drugs. MedicationStatement allows for the inclusion of other coding systems like the NCI Thesaurus (NCIT) to represent clinical trial oncology drugs.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-MedicationStatementPartOf-model.value[x]",1,1,"",""

Although FHIR MedicationAdministration supports date of administration, information source, performer, it lacks common provenance elements, statement creation date, author, and recorder. These are supported as optional extensions.
FHIR DSTU2 lacks a category attribute, which is provided as an extension in that version.
SHR does not allow the 'not given' attributes from DSTU2 and STU3, since they are dropped in R4. The status element is used to document medications not given.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-MedicationStatementPartOf-model.value[x]",1,1,"",""
