FHIR Notes:

Although FHIR supports the asserter (information source) and date asserted, it does not have a place for the author (who created and is responsible for the statement) and recorder (who entered the statement). Extensions are provided.

The treatment of 'not taken' has changed from DSTU2 and STU3 to R4. In R4, status and statusReason are used to indicate medications not taken. For upward compatibility, the 'not taken' attributes are profiled out.
ReasonCode is a choice of CodeableConcept or ref(Condition) in DSTU2, and limited to one reason (pick a type). In STU3 and R4, there can be multiple reason codes, and multiple reason references, simultaneously.

Preference is given to using the National Library of Medicine (NLM) RxNorm terminology for medications. RxNorm is a coding standard established by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC). However, RxNorm is restricted to FDA-approved drugs and does not include clinical trial drugs. MedicationStatement allows for the inclusion of other coding systems like the NCI Thesaurus (NCIT) to represent clinical trial oncology drugs.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-RespiratoryRate-model.observationPartOf[x]",0,*,"",""

* Specifying the distance from the landmark to the body location.

The RelationToLandmark element is part of BodyLocation, a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.

+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
- Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and
- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.

Note that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-RespiratoryRate-model.bodyLocation.relationToLandmark",0,*,"",""

Device status cannot be reconciled between Argonaut and US-Core, each having different required value sets.
Device type has extensible mappings to different value sets in Argonaut and US-Core, however both value sets have identical SNOMED content (descendants of 49062001 (Device).
