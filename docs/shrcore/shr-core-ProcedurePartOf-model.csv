Observation has a value representing the result (answer), or an DataAbsentReason indicating why the value is not present. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.
For an Observation, the Code describes the aspect or property of the subject being observed or measured. The Code is the 'question code' that pairs to the 'answer' contained in the Value.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-ProcedurePartOf-model.value[x]",1,1,"",""

Although FHIR MedicationAdministration supports date of administration, information source, performer, it lacks common provenance elements, statement creation date, author, and recorder. These are supported as optional extensions.
FHIR DSTU2 lacks a category attribute, which is provided as an extension in that version.
SHR does not allow the 'not given' attributes from DSTU2 and STU3, since they are dropped in R4. The status element is used to document medications not given.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-ProcedurePartOf-model.value[x]",1,1,"",""
