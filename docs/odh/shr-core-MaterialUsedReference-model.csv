In FHIR DSTU2 and STU3, Medication lacks the identifier attribute, which is included in SHR as an extension.
DSTU2 lacks the status attribute, which is required by US-Core.
Batch is 0..1 in FHIR R4, and accordingly is restricted here.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-MaterialUsedReference-model.value[x]",1,1,"",""

The same device might be used on multiple patients.
Device status cannot be reconciled between Argonaut and US-Core, each having different required value sets.
Device type has extensible mappings to different value sets in Argonaut and US-Core, however both value sets have identical SNOMED content (descendants of 49062001 (Device). We adopt the US-Core value set, which is allowable because the binding is extensible.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-MaterialUsedReference-model.value[x]",1,1,"",""
