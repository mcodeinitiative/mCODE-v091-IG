'Condition' is interpreted broadly and could be a disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, functionality, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, worry, or trouble.
The Observation-based class, ConditionAbsent, should be used to describe conditions that are not present or negative findings.
SHR Condition uses the SHR BodyLocation structure that includes not only a code, but optional laterality, direction, clock direction, and distance. If included, the distance is measured from the location specified by the code, laterality, and direction.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-Condition-model",0,*,"",""

The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.
+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
- Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and
- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.
Note that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-Condition-model.bodyLocation",0,*,"",""
