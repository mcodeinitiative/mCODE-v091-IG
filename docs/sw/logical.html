If the code for the body location includes laterality and/or anatomical direction, the corresponding attributes might be unnecessary.
Note that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how an address structure can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR’s stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which ‘is not … intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient’ (FHIR 3.5).</p>
