SHR follows Argonaut and makes the value set binding on marital status required. SHR also adds optional extensions on communication ability to more fully characterize language skills.
MaritalStatus has a required binding in Argonaut, but an extensible binding in US-Core. To be feasible under both DSTU2 Argonaut and STU3 US-Core, the required binding strength is adopted.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-Patient-model",0,*,"",""
