"shr-core-Device-model","","","",0,*,"","","","","","A specific durable physical device used in diagnosis or treatment. The value is the coding for a type of device, for example, a CPAP machine. The same device might be used on multiple patients.
Device status cannot be reconciled between Argonaut and US-Core, each having different required value sets.
Device type has extensible mappings to different value sets in Argonaut and US-Core, however both value sets have identical SNOMED content (descendants of 49062001 (Device). We adopt the US-Core value set, which is allowable because the binding is extensible.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-Device-model",0,*,"",""
