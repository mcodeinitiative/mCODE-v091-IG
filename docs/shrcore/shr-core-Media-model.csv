Body location is a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.
+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
- Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and
- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.
Note that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-Media-model.bodyLocation",0,1,"",""

Device status cannot be reconciled between Argonaut and US-Core, each having different required value sets.
Device type has extensible mappings to different value sets in Argonaut and US-Core, however both value sets have identical SNOMED content (descendants of 49062001 (Device).
