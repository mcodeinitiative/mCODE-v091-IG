  <p><b>SubjectOfRecord Logical Model</b></p>
  <p>The subject of a clinical statement, often called the Patient or the Subject. The SubjectOfRecord typically identifies the clinical record in which this statement is contained. If the statement should be in John Doe's patient record, then John Doe is the subject of record. When there is no patient, the SubjectOfRecord can also be a location, group, or other entity that statement pertains to. For example, observations concerning a hospital ward would have a Location as the SubjectOfRecord.

Note that the word 'Subject' is used here in the sense of a person or entity subjected to observations or actions, not subject as in a conceptual topic, like heart disease.</p>
