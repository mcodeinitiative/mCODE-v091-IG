"shr-core-Signature-model","","","",0,*,"","","","","","A Signature holds an electronic representation of a signature and its supporting context in a FHIR accessible form. The signature may either be a cryptographic type (XML DigSig or a JWS), which is able to provide non-repudiation proof, or it may be a graphical image that represents a signature or a signature process.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-Signature-model",0,*,"",""
