"shr-core-Specimen-model","","","",0,*,"","","","","","A specimen is a substance, physical object, or collection of objects, that the laboratory considers a single discrete, uniquely identified unit that is the subject of one or more steps in the laboratory workflow. A specimen may include multiple physical pieces as long as they are considered a single unit within the laboratory workflow. A specimen results from one to many specimen collection procedures, and may be contained in multiple specimen containers. Specimen may have one or more processing activities.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"shr-core-Specimen-model",0,*,"",""
